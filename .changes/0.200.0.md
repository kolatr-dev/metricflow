### Fixes

- Removes MySQL from SqlEngine and SqlDialect options since it is not supported. ([#0](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/0))
- Derived metrics were not respecting the constraint defined in the original input metric's definition.
- Fixes type error in BigQuerySqlExpressionRenderer ([#536](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/536))
- Fix broken type signature for log_call decorator
- Apply transformations to dbt-generated serialized model to fix issue with query generation ([#624](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/624))
- Improve error message rendering in MetricFlow CLI ([#646](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/646))

- Clean up list dimensions outputs

### Under the Hood

- Adding Changie ([#457](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/457))
- Ensure use of ValidationIssue instead of ValidationIssueType. ValidationIssueType was from a time before ValidationIssue classes had proper inheritance, and it's continued use was become problematic for typing.
- Removing `model` from the `ModelValidator.validate` return type. The model isn't altered, and thus doesn't need to be returned.
- Moving AggregationType enum into dbt-semantic-interfaces
- Moving errors relevant to dbt_semantic_interfaces to dbt_semantic_interfaces
- Migrating to RapidFuzz ([#470](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/470))
- Matching dbt-core issue templates ([#457](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/457))
- Removing the transform CLA ([#450](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/450))
- Pinning dbt-core to 1.4 ([#475](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/475))
- Removing YamlLint ([#472](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/472))
- Add ObjectToReference class in preparation of removing the .reference calls ([##463,](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/#463,), [##464](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/#464))
- Moving all *Reference objects to dbt-semantic-interfaces.
- Add pytest flag to use a persistent source schema for faster repeat testing. ([#482](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/482))
- Renamed instances of and related to Identifiers to Entities. ([#dbt-semantic-interfaces#9](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/dbt-semantic-interfaces#9))
- Improves typechecking coverage by updgrading to MyPy 0.942 and removing blanket ignore all imports setting ([#536](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/536))
- Push mypy to run using local environment packages in pre-commit. Developers should always use a clean virtual environment to ensure consistency with CI. ([#530](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/530), [#536](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/536))
- Update mypy to 1.3.0 ([#546](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/546))
- Migrate from Poetry -> Hatch for Project / Package Management ([#549](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/549))
- Enable the ability to return only dimensions requested in the query, specifically used for dimension values queries.
- Raising a UnsupportedEngineFeatureError instead of a generic RuntimeError when a data platform doesn't support a feature
- Remove SqlIsolationLevel constructs and other vestigial remnants of defunct SqlClient features ([#577](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/577))
- Raise a more specific exception when a Metric isn't found during linking.
- Update test environment configuration to allow for more streamlined dependencies
- Remove DDL and other unused methods from SqlClient protocol
